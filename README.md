Surrogacy is surrounded by myths like "surrogates are paid to give away their child" or "only celebrities use surrogacy." In reality, surrogacy is a legal and ethical reproductive option for couples who can't carry a pregnancy due to medical reasons. Surrogates don’t donate their eggs—they only carry the baby, making the child biologically the intended parents’. The process involves legal agreements and psychological screening. It's a deeply compassionate act, not a transaction. Surrogacy is especially valuable for women with uterine problems, recurrent miscarriages, or serious health risks.
